The Computer will Generate a random number between 19 - 120

From there the player will click on the picture of a gem that will be worth a number between 1-12. You will want to click on the Gems to add up to the number equal to the randomly generated number. 

If you go over the amount you lose, if you get an exact match to the random number you win. 

Everytime you lose or win there will be a newly random generated number and the number vlaue for each gem will also change.
